# SAS-model
Code for paper [Learning Credit Assignment](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.178301) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 178301 (2020)) (Arxiv: 2001.03354). We put forward a model with random weight characterized by a spike massing at zero and a slab represented by a Gaussian distribution, which obtains comparable or even better performance than traditional models. A general backpropagation method (gBP) is derived out from this perspective.
