# SAS Model
Code for MNIST handwritten digits dataset in paper [Learning Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03354)
# Requirements:
* python 3.7.4 
* torch 1.3.1 (pytorch)
* [THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
# How to run the code
## code for network structure [784,100,100,10]
`
python DNN-SAS-MNIST.py
`

If you want to change the structure of network and the style of dataset, try to change the way the pictures are loaded and the structure of networks in the main function.
